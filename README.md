# Classic-Pokedex

This is a small web application which uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript loads up an eternal API and enables to viewing of details through a modal. At first the bootstrap was not used to make the layout, but opted to use bootstrap for UI purposes

This project is dependant on an external API and pulls from https://pokeapi.co and only loads the first 150 pokemon. I opted to use JavaScript instead of jQuery.

I ran into a problem where I was calling too many functions into the app where it wouldn't load the modal. It taught me to keep my code simple and easy to follow.

To run this application,
you will need to open the file "index.html" in your browser
